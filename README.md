## Using the Repository

1.  Ensure the following software is installed:
    - Node.js
    - NPM
    - MongoDB
2.  Clone the git repository
3.  Install the dependencies by running:

    ```
    cd ./client/
    npm install
    cd ../server
    npm install
    cd ../testing
    npm install
    ```

4.  Create the Environment Files:

    - In `./client` create a file called `.env` and add the following line

      ```
      REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000
      ```

    - In `./server` create a file called `.env` and add the following lines

      ```
      MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
      CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
      PORT=8000
      ```

5.  Populate MongoDB by running:
    ```
    cd ./server/
    npm run populate-db
    ```
6.  Start the server by running:

    ```
    cd ./server/
    npm run start
    ```

7.  Start the client by running:
    ```
    cd ./client/
    npm run start
    ```
8.  Starting bug hunting by opening http://localhost:3000

## Codebase Folder Structure

- `client`: Contains the frontend application code, responsible for the user interface and interacting with the backend. This directory includes all React components and related assets.
- `server`: Contains the backend application code, handling the logic, APIs, and database interactions. It serves requests from the client and processes data accordingly.
- `shared`: Contains all shared type definitions that are used by both the client and server. This helps maintain consistency and reduces duplication of code between the two folders. The type definitions are imported and shared within each folder's `types/types.ts` file.

## Database Architecture

The schemas for the database are documented in the directory `server/models/schema`.
A class diagram for the schema definition is shown below:

## Running Stryker Mutation Testing

Mutation testing helps you measure the effectiveness of your tests by introducing small changes (mutations) to your code and checking if your tests catch them. To run mutation testing with Stryker, use the following command in `server/`:

```sh
npm run stryker
```

{ : .note } In case you face an "out of memory" error while running Stryker, use the following command to increase the memory allocation to 4GB for Node.js:

```sh
node --max-old-space-size=4096 ./node_modules/.bin/stryker run
```
