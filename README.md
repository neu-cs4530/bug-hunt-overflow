## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Project Structure
- `client/`: Frontend React application
- `server/`: Backend Node.js application
- `shared/`: Shared TypeScript type definitions

### API Documentation
For detailed API documentation, please refer to the [API Routes](#api-routes) section below.


## Codebase Folder Structure

- `client`: Contains the frontend application code, responsible for the user interface and interacting with the backend. This directory includes all React components and related assets.
- `server`: Contains the backend application code, handling the logic, APIs, and database interactions. It serves requests from the client and processes data accordingly.
- `shared`: Contains all shared type definitions that are used by both the client and server. This helps maintain consistency and reduces duplication of code between the two folders. The type definitions are imported and shared within each folder's `types/types.ts` file.

## Database Architecture

The schemas for the database are documented in the directory `server/models/schema`.
A class diagram for the schema definition is shown below:

## Running Stryker Mutation Testing

Mutation testing helps you measure the effectiveness of your tests by introducing small changes (mutations) to your code and checking if your tests catch them. To run mutation testing with Stryker, use the following command in `server/`:

```sh
npm run stryker
```

{ : .note } In case you face an "out of memory" error while running Stryker, use the following command to increase the memory allocation to 4GB for Node.js:

```sh
node --max-old-space-size=4096 ./node_modules/.bin/stryker run
```
